# Terms & Conditions

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – therefore you should make sure that you read them carefully before using the app. Although it’s code is publicly available, the app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Ultraviolet Studio.

Third-party services used on the Occupy Worlds app may require Personally Identifiable Data, but it will never be required, requested or stored directly by the developer of this app.

The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

Along the same lines, Ultraviolet Studio cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app.

It’s important to bear in mind that, although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Ultraviolet Studio accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Ultraviolet Studio does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. 

## Changes to This Terms and Conditions

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-04-02
